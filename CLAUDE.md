# CLAUDE.md — 4Pie Labs Client Portal

Guidance for Claude Code working in this repo. **`PORTAL_SPEC.md` is the source
of truth** — read it fully before writing code. This file is the quick-reference
summary; if the two ever disagree, the spec wins, and update this file to match.

## What this is

A private, invite-only client portal for **4Pie Labs** (an AI-first marketing
agency for local service businesses). Replaces a Notion client-portal template
and covers the full lifecycle: onboarding → delivery → reporting → off-boarding.
Four programs: Foundation, Pipeline, Operating System, Pulse.

- **Completely separate** from the marketing site: own repo, own Vercel project,
  own Supabase project.
- **Production domain:** `portal.fourpielabs.com`.

## Tech stack (fixed — do not substitute)

- Next.js 15+, App Router, TypeScript, **Server Components by default**
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- Supabase: Postgres, Auth, Storage, **Row Level Security**
- `@supabase/ssr` for server + browser clients; session refresh in `middleware.ts`
- Recharts (charts); React Hook Form + Zod (forms)
- Vercel hosting (auto-deploy on push to `main`); Supabase CLI for all migrations
- Brand: match fourpielabs.com — clean, modern, **amber/orange accent (~`#d97706`)**.
  The client-facing side must feel like a product, not an admin panel.

## Roles & access control (3 roles, RLS-enforced)

`profiles.role` enum = `admin | team | client`. **ALL enforcement is via Postgres
RLS**; UI role checks are convenience only and server actions re-check too.

- **admin** — full CRUD on everything; manages users/clients/assignments; reads audit log.
- **team** — full CRUD only for clients assigned via `client_assignments`. No unassigned
  clients, no user management.
- **client** — read-only on their own client's data where `visible_to_client = true`
  (reports also require `published = true`). **Exactly one write path:** toggling
  onboarding checklist items where `assignee = 'client'`, only via the
  `toggle_checklist_item(item_id)` SECURITY DEFINER function. No direct client UPDATE
  policy exists on any table.

**Signup policy:** no public signup; Supabase email signups disabled. Accounts exist
only via admin invitations (`inviteUserByEmail` from a server route; role + client_id
in invite metadata; a trigger on `auth.users` creates the `profiles` row).

## Database & migrations

- All tables in `public`, **RLS enabled on every table**.
- **Supabase migrations only** (`supabase/migrations/*.sql`) — never ad-hoc schema changes.
- RLS helpers (SECURITY DEFINER): `is_admin()`, `is_team()`, `my_client_id()`,
  `is_assigned(cid)`, `toggle_checklist_item(item_id)`.
- `clients.internal_notes` is **never** readable by clients — expose client-safe columns
  via a view / column grants.
- Triggers seed on client insert: onboarding + off-boarding checklists, the 90-day
  milestone roadmap, and program-specific metric definitions.
- Storage: private bucket `client-files`, path `{client_id}/{uuid}-{filename}`, policies
  mirror table rules; downloads via short-lived signed URLs from server actions.

Tables (see spec §4 for columns): `clients`, `profiles`, `client_assignments`,
`checklist_items`, `milestones`, `deliverables`, `content_items`,
`metric_definitions`, `metric_entries`, `competitors`, `call_types`,
`call_recordings`, `meeting_notes`, `reports`, `updates`, `files`, `invitations`,
`audit_log`.

## App structure

App Router under `app/`: `(auth)/` (login, accept-invite, forgot-password) and
`(portal)/` (dashboard, clients/[clientId]/{checklist,program,content,metrics,
competitors,deliverables,calls,notes,reports,updates,files,settings},
admin/{users,audit}, settings). `middleware.ts` handles session refresh + auth
redirects. Supabase clients in `lib/supabase/{server,client,admin}.ts`; auth guards
in `lib/auth/guards.ts`.

**Client-facing nav:** Dashboard · Program · Content · Performance · Deliverables ·
Calls & Notes · Documents. Zero edit affordances beyond the onboarding checklist toggle.

## Conventions

- Mutations via **server actions only**; Zod validation; re-check role server-side
  even though RLS protects; **write `audit_log` on every mutation**.
- Service-role key is **server-only — never `NEXT_PUBLIC`**.
- Loading / empty / error states everywhere; fully mobile-responsive (clients use phones).
  Friendly empty states.

## Build phases (complete + verify each before the next)

- **P1 Foundation** — scaffold; all migrations (enums, tables, helpers, RLS, storage,
  seeding triggers); auth (login, accept-invite, middleware, role redirects); seed
  script (1 admin, 1 team, 2 demo clients [pipeline + pulse], 1 client user). Verify
  `supabase db reset` runs clean.
- **P2 Admin** — clients CRUD (triggers seeding), invite flow, users list/deactivate,
  team↔client assignments, audit viewer.
- **P3 Team core** — client overview; checklist editor; program page + milestones;
  deliverables; files/documents; updates.
- **P4 Team trackers** — content calendar; metrics (definitions, monthly grid, CSV
  import, charts); competitors; call types + recordings; meeting notes; reports + publish.
- **P5 Client experience** — full client UI; `toggle_checklist_item` flow; branded
  polish; signed-URL downloads; report viewer.
- **P6 Hardening & launch** — RLS verification tests (cross-client reads/writes must
  fail; unassigned-team access must fail); audit coverage; mobile/Lighthouse; deploy +
  custom domain.

> **Current status:** P1 (Foundation) IN PROGRESS — app scaffolded and all
> migrations written, **awaiting migration review before any `supabase db push`**.
> Auth flow (login/accept-invite/forgot-password, middleware redirects) and the
> seed script are deferred to after review approval. Route pages under
> `app/(portal)/.../` are placeholders built out in P2–P5.
>
> Scaffold facts: Next.js 16 (App Router) + React 19 + Tailwind v4 +
> shadcn/ui (radix). Brand amber accent in `app/globals.css`. Supabase clients
> in `lib/supabase/{server,client,admin,middleware}.ts`; session-refresh
> `middleware.ts` (Next 16 deprecates this name in favor of `proxy.ts` — renamed
> in step 4 when adding redirects). Migrations: `supabase/migrations/2026061001000{1..8}_*.sql`.
> Signups disabled in `supabase/config.toml`.

### Schema notes

- **Enums: exactly the 14 from spec §4** — `user_role`, `client_status`,
  `client_industry`, `program_tier`, `checklist_kind`, `checklist_assignee`,
  `milestone_status`, `deliverable_status`, `deliverable_type`, `content_status`,
  `content_platform`, `metric_unit`, `file_category`, `competitor_priority`.
  No extras. (A step-3 report said "16 enums" — that was a miscount; the
  migration always defined 14.)
- **Review changes applied pre-push (R1–R3):**
  - R1 — no client policy on `storage.objects`; clients get files ONLY via
    server-minted signed URLs after a `files.visible_to_client` check.
  - R2 — `enforce_profile_self_update()` allows the `service_role` context
    (`auth.role() = 'service_role'`) so admin/seed server actions aren't blocked.
  - R3 — `client_clients` and the new `client_partner` definer view both use
    explicit column lists (never `select *`); `client_partner` exposes only
    `id, full_name, avatar_url, email`; the old full-row `client_select_partner`
    profiles policy was removed.

### Setup status (as of 2026-06-10)

Done:
- Repo initialized; remote `origin` = `github.com/fourpielabs/fourpielabs-portal`
  (private). `main` pushed.
- `PORTAL_SPEC.md`, this `CLAUDE.md`, `.gitignore`, `.env.local.example`, and
  `supabase/` scaffold committed. `.env.local` present locally and gitignored.
- `.mcp.json` at project scope: read-only hosted Supabase MCP
  (`mcp.supabase.com`, `project_ref=frmukrgjkhlpxplhzeqj`, `read_only=true`) +
  Vercel MCP (`mcp.vercel.com`). Secrets via `${SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN}` /
  `${SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF}` expansion — no literals committed.
- Vercel project connected to the repo: the push **triggered a production
  deployment**, which **failed as expected** (no Next.js app/`package.json`
  yet). Deploys will go green once P1 scaffolds the app.

Done:
- **`supabase link` complete and verified on the fourpielabs project.** The
  fourpielabs `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` (persisted at Windows User scope)
  overrode the CLI's stored personal login; `supabase projects list` shows the
  `●` LINKED marker on `frmukrgjkhlpxplhzeqj` = `fourpielabs-portal`
  (org `sokuiylewhqvrpfsafxv`), and `supabase/.temp/project-ref` matches. The
  DB password was skipped at link time — supply it (prompt or
  `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD`) before the first `supabase db push`.
- `.mcp.json` now hardcodes the (public, non-secret) `project_ref`; only the
  token comes from `${SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN}` env expansion.

Pending — in-IDE Supabase MCP connection:
- The hosted MCP server reads `${SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN}` from **Claude Code's
  own process env**, which is still stale: env vars are captured when the VS
  Code app launches, and a new Claude *session* inside an already-running VS
  Code does **not** re-read them. The token IS persisted at User scope (so a
  fresh VS Code launch will inherit it) — the running process just predates it.
- **To finish:** fully **quit and reopen VS Code** (the whole app, not just a
  new Claude chat), approve the project-scope `supabase` MCP server when
  prompted, then run `/mcp` to confirm `supabase` shows **connected
  (read-only)**. Credential validity is already proven (link + projects list
  succeeded with this token), so this is the last mechanical step.
- After that, the environment-setup phase is fully signed off — only then start P1.

## Environment & tooling

`.env.local` (never commit) holds the four spec §7 vars:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=          # server only
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=               # localhost:3000 locally; prod URL on Vercel
```

- Supabase CLI linked to the 4Pie Labs project; migrate with `supabase db push` /
  `supabase db reset`. `supabase link` reads `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` from the
  environment — never hardcode or echo it.
- Push to `main` → Vercel auto-deploys.
- **MCP servers are configured at PROJECT scope only** (`.mcp.json` in this repo),
  authenticated against 4Pie Labs accounts. **Never** touch the developer's
  global/user-scope MCP config (personal accounts). Secrets in `.mcp.json` use
  `${VAR}` expansion, not literals.

## Non-goals for v1 (do not build)

Live API integrations (GSC/GA4/Google Ads/Meta/Ahrefs — `metric_entries` is the future
integration point); client comments/approvals beyond the checklist toggle; billing
engine (invoices are just files); real-time notifications; white-labeling; multi-language.
